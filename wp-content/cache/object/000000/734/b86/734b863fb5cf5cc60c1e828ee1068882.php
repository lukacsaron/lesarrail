It is also possible to connect at goundfloor level with Maison Figue if required and the terrace has a cleverly designed division that can be opened to join the two terraces together, thus creating one large house and terrace to share with friends and family.

The groundfloor is spacious and semi-open plan with a fully equipped kitchen, dining area with table seating six and a comfortable lounge area with wood burning stove. Two large glass doors open directly onto the shaded terrace which overlooks the gardens and takes in the view of the Pyr√©nees.
