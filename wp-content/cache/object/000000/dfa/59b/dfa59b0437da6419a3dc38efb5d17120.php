The large heated swimming pool is a haven for children with plenty of inflatable toys at their disposal, for peace of mind, the pool is fenced with a child-proof gate and has an electronically operated hard security cover which is closed at night for extra safety. Sunloungers and parasols surround the swimming pool and, within the enclosure is a cute shady wooden cabin with toys, that children can enjoy in the heat of the day.

Within sight of the houses there is a children's play area with slide and swings, as well as log cabin and 14 foot trampoline, fitted with a safety net so that even toddlers can enjoy it. The 1000 sq ft shady barn is enclosed on three sides and is equipped with ride-ons, toys and beautiful chillout area - perfect for parents to enjoy a sundowner!

An unusual underground vaulted games room, with a year round cool ambient temperature, offers hours of fun for all the family with table football, table tennis and other family games.

Alternatively, there is a slower pace - we are in the south of France after all - simple picnics in the grounds or a game of Boules as the sun goes down usually pleases most children and parents alike.

Everything you need for the younger members of your family can be provided, such as; cots, bedguards, stairgates, highchairs, pushchairs, booster seats, changing mats, toys, books and much more. If you would like a night out without the children to sample some of the wonderful local restaurants, trusted babysitting can also be arranged.";s:10:"post_title";s:4:"Kids";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:4:"kids";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-04-25 01:47:14";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-04-25 01:47:14";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:39:"http://beta.lesarrail.co.uk/?page_id=22";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
